## Description & Motivations

This project aims to port over and enhance all of the assignments completed for
NYU Tandon's [Intro to Game Programming (CS-UY 3113)](https://github.com/sebastianromerocruz/CS3113-intro-to-game-programming) 
during the Spring 2025 semester, going from [SDL2](https://libsdl.org) with OpenGL to
[MoonWorks](https://github.com/MoonsideGames/MoonWorks).

The primary objectives for this project are to improve the cross-platform 
portability of these assignment submissions, to transition from proprietary to
public domain or original assets, and to get hands-on experience with a modern 
game development framework and _entity-component-system_ (ECS) as an
architectural design philosophy. 

As such, the hope is that, by porting these assignments, they can become
more performant, more accessible, and more fun from the extra _tender loving 
care_ (TLC).
